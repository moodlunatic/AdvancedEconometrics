# AdvancedEconometrics
This is the project based on advanced econometrics.
Wald test, Likelihood ratio (LR) test and Score test are three classical tests that compare a restricted model (the null model) against an unrestricted model (the alternative model). 
I try to illuif the null hypothesis is true, 
(1) the distribution of the three test statistics follow chi-square distribution asymptotically, 
(2) the differences among the three tests vanish as 𝑛 → ∞. 

Also, I will set the null hypothesis to be false and check the results of the three test statistics.
