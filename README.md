Wald test, Likelihood ratio (LR) test and Score test are three classical tests that compare a restricted model (the null model) against an unrestricted model (the alternative model).

---
To conduct a likelihood ratio test, you need to estimate both the restricted and unrestricted models.
To conduct a Lagrange multiplier test, you only need to estimate the restricted model (but the test requires an estimate of the variance-covariance matrix).
To conduct a Wald test, you only need to estimate the unrestricted model (but the test requires an estimate of the variance-covariance matrix).

# I try to illustrate the theory that if the null hypothesis is true

(1) the distribution of the three test statistics follow chi-square distribution asymptotically, 
(2) the differences among the three tests vanish as ùëõ ‚Üí ‚àû. 

Also, I will set the null hypothesis to be false and check the results of the three test statistics.
